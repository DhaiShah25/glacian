# Introduction

## Game Summary

A voxel game where the player is a robot exploring a post-nuclear war world.
This world will be frozen and coated in ice with vegetation being rare. One of
the struggles will be finding a consistent source of energy to power yourself.
You start with a nuclear battery which lasts for a very long time but provides
very little power. It will be enough for powering the base but not any upgrades.

## Inspiration

- Lost Terminal: This is inspired by the protagonist Seth who is an artificial
  intelligence trying to piece together the world around him.
